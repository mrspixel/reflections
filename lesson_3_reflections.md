__When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?__

    If I would like to share my work or have others collaborate with it.

__Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?__

        I wouldn\'t want it to automatically sync sometimes. 

__Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?__

        Forks are clones made on the Github server. Clones are made from the Github server to your local machine. Branches are a way of naming your repositories.  I would use them as they are intended.
