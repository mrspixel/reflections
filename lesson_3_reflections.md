__When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?__

    If I would like to share my work or have others collaborate with it.

__Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?__

        I wouldn\'t want it to automatically sync sometimes. 

__Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?__

        Forks are clones made on the Github server. Clones are made from the Github server to your local machine. Branches are a way of naming your repositories.  I would use them as they are intended.

__What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?__

        In case changes were made during collaboration and your edits weren\'t included.

__How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?__

        If speaking in person is not an option, then there are various forms of communicating. Like via pigeons for instance. It would definitely be harder and would involve two different platforms for collaborating on the project. This is why utilizing GitHub is so much easier!

__When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?__

Whenever I wanted to try something new without affecting the master file directly. The benefit of this is that I will leave the master file completely unharmed while going ape shit with troubleshooting.
