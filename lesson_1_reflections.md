__How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?__

    It was much easier to decipher between the two scripts. The color difference is very helpful as well. GIT seems pretty badass so far!

__How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?__

    If you ever need reference from old files, then there is a repository of them. More work to save your ass and prove your work!

__What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?__

    Less file storage and you have complete control on the specific time to save.

__Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?__

    They were designed differently. GIT was designed with code in mind. Also, we decide when we want to save our files.

__How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?__

    Git Log will show all the commits (user-created checkpoints). Git Diff will show the differences between files.

__How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?__

    There's re-assurance that I can start over.

__Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?__

    I'm honestly not sure yet. I just want to continue being a sponge and soak up all this useful information!
